## 📊 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE (Next 24 Hours)
1. **Add package.json metadata** to CLI and MCP server for npm publishing
2. **Build GitHub Action** (run `pnpm build` in `packages/github-action`)
3. **Record 60-second demo video** showing:
   - `npx @secretforge/cli init`
   - Keys getting detected and provisioned
   - GitHub Action catching a secret in PR
4. **Create Twitter account** (@SecretForgeAI)
5. **Write launch tweet thread** (template in LAUNCH_PLAN.md)

### SHORT-TERM (This Week)
1. **Publish to npm**: `@secretforge/cli` and `@secretforge/mcp-server`
2. **Deploy landing page** to Vercel/Cloudflare Pages
3. **Submit to Product Hunt** (schedule for best time)
4. **Post on Reddit** (r/programming, r/webdev, r/devops)
5. **Submit GitHub Action** to Marketplace

### MEDIUM-TERM (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Implement Stripe payments** in API
2. **Build pricing page** with tiers
3. **Add usage tracking** (secrets count, rotations, API calls)
4. **Create demo environment** (demo.secretforge.ai)
5. **Set up Discord server** for community

## 💰 Revenue Projections

**Conservative Scenario:**
- Week 1: 50 paying users × $29 = **$1,450 MRR**
- Month 1: 500 paying users × $29 = **$14,500 MRR**
- Month 3: 2,000 paying users × $29 = **$58,000 MRR**

**Optimistic Scenario** (if viral):
- Week 1: 200 paying users = **$5,800 MRR**
- Month 1: 1,500 paying users = **$43,500 MRR**
- Month 3: 5,000 paying users = **$145,000 MRR**

**Why this is achievable:**
- Low price point ($29 vs $100+ competitors)
- Massive TAM (27M developers globally)
- Real pain point (everyone hates .env files)
- Viral distribution (GitHub comments, MCP)

## 🎨 What You Can Show Off Today

### 1. **The GitHub Action**
"I built a GitHub Action that not only catches exposed API keys but auto-provisions secure replacements. It's like having a security engineer review every PR."

### 2. **The Architecture**
"Built with Cloudflare's new Agents API (stateful AI with embedded SQLite), Model Context Protocol for AI assistant integration, and deployed at the edge for <50ms latency globally."

### 3. **The Vision**
"Imagine never having to manage .env files again. Every API key automatically provisioned, rotated, and validated for compliance. That's SecretForge."
